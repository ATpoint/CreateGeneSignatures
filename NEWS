Log of changes between versions:

v2.2.2:
- minor changes in DESCRIPTION and render plots via GitHub Actions
- extend test.R script to render the plot in README.md and update via Actions

v2.2.1:
- fixing bugs and edge cases, robustified

v2.2.0:
- added `extended` argument to output a full data.frame that indicates whether a gene qualified as a marker for the particular
group against the other groups. Makes sense if min.prop < 1 to see which groups exactly the gene does not separate. Also some 
fixes to use_groups, now if min.prop < 1 a gene must have the same "off-target" pattern to qualify as a marker for these combined groups.
Some updates in the examples.

v2.1.0: 
- added exclude_groups to CreateGeneSignatures() to remove groups from the signature process

v2.0.1:
-fix typos in example section

v2.0.0:
- now support defining signatures for a group of celltypes, e.g. in the example set CD4T and CD8T versus the rest.
This has the advantage that these two groups are not compared against each other which is beneficial as they share a lot of markers
and one only cares about genes that separate both from the rest but not from each other.

v1.1.0:
-made the ranking function robust against syntactically-invalid R names which in the previous version would have returned no genes at all

v1.0.1: 
-changed code example for plotting a heatmap based on the signatures

v1.0.0:
-initial Github commit
