Log of changes between versions:

v2.1.0: 
- added exclude_groups to CreateGeneSignatures() to remove groups from the signature process

v2.0.1:
-fix typos in example section

v2.0.0:
- now support defining signatures for a group of celltypes, e.g. in the example set CD4T and CD8T versus the rest.
This has the advantage that these two groups are not compared against each other which is beneficial as they share a lot of markers
and one only cares about genes that separate both from the rest but not from each other.

v1.1.0:
-made the ranking function robust against syntactically-invalid R names which in the previous version would have returned no genes at all

v1.0.1: 
-changed code example for plotting a heatmap based on the signatures

v1.0.0:
-initial Github commit
